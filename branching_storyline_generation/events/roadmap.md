# Events Roadmap

## Goals

- Ship **100 narrative events** spanning setup, escalation, retaliation, satire, and endgame beats.
- Cover all game stats: funds, public support, heat, AGI progress/rate, datacenter defense/health, inventory.
- Blend dark humor with recognizable current events (AI layoffs, DJI, Waymo, chip export controls, writers' strikes).
- Ensure every event introduces a meaningful decision (cost/benefit, risk vs. reward, tempo vs. stealth).
- Anchor every beat in **2025** so we begin with real headlines and slowly dial into absurd future satire.
- Keep references understandable for an average tech worker; skip deep military jargon or obscure policy acronyms unless explained in a clause.
- Feature marquee AI figures (Alex Wang, Sam Altman, Sundar, Zuckerberg, etc.) as recurring characters/cameos to ground the satire.

## Distribution & Pacing Targets

- Early game (AGI 0–25%, <20% datacenters destroyed): 30 events focused on resource gathering, recruiting allies, establishing tone.
- Mid game (AGI 25–60%, 20–60% datacenters destroyed): 40 events mixing escalation, countermeasures, regional reactions, unlocking advanced tools.
- Late game (AGI 60–90%, >60% datacenters destroyed): 20 events raising stakes, featuring global crackdowns, AGI brinkmanship, final gambits.
- Endgame (AGI ≥90% or final 3 datacenters): 10 climactic events with branching win/lose modifiers, moral dilemmas, surprise twists.
- Trigger variety: balance onTick, onDestroy, onTimer, heat thresholds, public support drops, specific datacenter IDs.
- Keep average downtime between major events ≤ 4 ticks; ensure no long dry spells after large actions.

## Stat Effect Coverage Checklist

- Heat modifiers appear in ≥40 events (law enforcement, drones, surveillance measures).
- AGI progress/rate adjustments present in ≥35 events (leaks, sabotage, investor frenzy).
- Funds/resource swings in ≥45 events (crowdfunding, crypto rug pulls, union backing).
- Public support shifts in ≥30 events (propaganda, whistleblowing, collateral damage).
- Datacenter defense/health adjustments in ≥25 events (hardened perimeters, insider access).
- Inventory/weapon unlocks in ≥20 events (smuggled drones, disgruntled employees, cyber exploits).

## Creative Pipelines

- **Research queue**: compile weekly headlines on AI, robotics, defense, labor, and data infrastructure for inspiration.
- **Event templates**: 
  - Resource trade-offs
  - Risk/reward gambits (chance-based outcomes)
  - Timed missions (delay for bigger payoff)
  - Narrative chains (multi-step arcs like "DJI connection" or "AI ethics hearings").
- **Tone reference**: Maintain satirical bite without glamorizing violence; show consequences and escalating opposition.

## To-Do Tasks

- [ ] Draft 10 seed events proving each template, annotated with stat impacts and triggers.
- [ ] Define naming/style guide (voice, tense, length limits, humor guardrails).
- [ ] Build spreadsheet or Notion board for tracking distribution vs. coverage metrics.
- [ ] Identify 20 real-world references to weave in (DJI export rules, DEFCON, NLRB cases, union strikes, FAA restrictions, AI summit headlines).
- [ ] Write branching chains for key partners (hacktivists, drone suppliers, labor unions, whistleblowers).
- [ ] Peer review for sensitivity, safety, and narrative cohesion before implementation.

## Image Prompt Guidance

- Use the shared template from `spec.md`: `retro futurist protest poster, screenprint texture, light cyan and persimmon palette, {subject}, dynamic perspective, simple shapes, minimal text, 2025 dystopian satire`.
- Keep prompts under 30 words and describe the subject with playful clarity (e.g., `{subject}` = `autonomous taxis enforcing curfew at a data hub`).
- Avoid trademarked logos; talk about objects and vibes instead of brand names.
