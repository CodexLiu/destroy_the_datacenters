# Visual & Tone Style Guide

## Core Theme

- Vibe: **Retro-futurist protest zine** set in 2025 â€” equal parts sardonic tech optimism and grassroots resistance.
- Palette: light cyan (#8ff5ff), persimmon (#ff6b4a), midnight navy (#121c2d), off-white (#f7f1e8) for backgrounds.
- Texture: Screenprint grain, halftone shadows, chunky vector silhouettes.
- Typography (UI reference): bold geometric sans (e.g., Space Grotesk) for titles, monospace accents for stats.

## AI Image Prompt Template

```
retro futurist protest poster, screenprint texture, light cyan and persimmon palette, {subject}, dynamic perspective, simple shapes, minimal text, 2025 dystopian satire
```

- Replace `{subject}` with a <=10-word description (e.g., `autonomous taxis enforcing curfew outside a glowing data hub`).
- Always mention 2025 context when helpful (`2025 tech layoff survivors`, `2025 desert data fortress`).
- Avoid trademarked terms; speak in generic imagery.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Event cards**: Highlight moment + consequence; include crowd/character focus. Subject template: `cunning activists reacting to {situation}`.
- **Weapons/tools**: Focus on device/action; angle should feel like a manual sketch. Subject template: `{weapon nickname} being prepped by laid-off tech workers`.
- **Datacenter map art**: Emphasize architecture/environment; show surveillance or environmental strain.

## Tone & Language

- All copy references 2025 explicitly or implicitly ("post-2024 layoffs", "2025 safety summit").
- Humor is clever and legible: reference mainstream tech culture, not deep classified jargon.
- Balance satire with stakes; mention consequences (heat, public backlash) alongside jokes.
