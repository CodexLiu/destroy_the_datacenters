# Weapons Roadmap

## Goals

- Deliver **35 distinct weapons/tactics** spanning physical sabotage, cyber warfare, social manipulation, publicity, and support assets.
- Maintain a mix of comedic plausibility: improvised devices, drone-based delivery, insider leaks, union strikes, meme campaigns.
- Ensure each weapon modifies at least two axes (damage, stealth, heat, funds, AGI rate, public support) to keep decisions meaningful.
- Provide at least 6 weapon chains that upgrade through events or achievements.
- Root every concept in a **2025** timeline so the arsenal riffs on headlines tech workers know (supply chain drama, safety debates) before escalating into absurd future tech.
- Keep descriptions punchy and readable; prefer metaphors and analogies over dense tactical jargon.

## Categorization Targets

1. **Improvised Explosives (8)** — molotov cocktails, fertilizer trucks, battery bank overloads; high damage, high heat.
2. **Drone/Remote Ops (7)** — DJI-based rigs, crop dusters, payload drops, swarm distractions; moderate damage, mid stealth.
3. **Cyber & Insider (8)** — ransomware, firmware backdoors, disgruntled sysadmins, supply-chain tampering; damage + AGI slowdown.
4. **Social & Propaganda (6)** — documentary premieres, whistleblower leaks, coordinated walkouts; heat reduction, public support swings.
5. **Support Assets (6)** — van rentals, burner warehouses, AI safety think-tank infiltration; unlock modifiers, cooldown reductions.

## Stat Effect Coverage

- Damage output tiers: light (≤15), medium (16–35), heavy (36–60), catastrophic (>60) with at least 5 weapons in each non-catastrophic tier.
- Stealth values: at least 10 weapons with stealth ≥0.5, 10 with ≤0.2 to force trade-offs.
- Heat modifiers: 20 weapons add heat, 10 reduce or redistribute heat.
- Funds: acquisition costs range 0–1000; ensure budget curve allows starter, mid, and late-game options.
- AGI impact: at least 8 weapons reduce AGI rate when used (e.g., data poisoning, chip heists).
- Public support: 6 weapons increase, 6 decrease to reflect collateral consequences.

## Unlock & Progression Ideas

- Baseline arsenal: 5 starter tools unlocked at game start.
- Event-driven unlocks: 15 weapons tied to specific narrative chains (DJI partnership, laid-off programmers, hacktivist collective).
- Achievement gates: 5 weapons unlocked after destroying region clusters (e.g., "Pac-NW blackout").
- Heat-scaling: 5 high-risk weapons available only when heat ≥40 to encourage comeback swings.
- Crafting/combo weapons: allow combining components (e.g., "Tacoma Surprise" = truck + fertilizer + guidance drone).

## To-Do Tasks

- [ ] Brainstorm weapon names and flavor blurbs (1–2 sentences) for each category; ensure tonal consistency.
- [ ] Map each weapon to iconography requirements (Font Awesome, custom vector, etc.).
- [ ] Define numerical stats (damage, variance, stealth, cooldown, cost) and cross-check balance vs. events.
- [ ] Tag weapons with unlock conditions (event IDs, stat thresholds, achievements).
- [ ] Research current tech headlines (DJI restrictions, Boston Dynamics demos, union strikes, data center cooling incidents) for plausibility references.
- [ ] Create spreadsheet for stat balancing and progression curves; include simulated time-to-win metrics.
- [ ] Draft AI image prompts using the shared style template for every weapon and support asset.
- [ ] Run humor/sensitivity pass to avoid glorifying real-world harm while preserving satirical edge.

## Image Prompt Guidance

- Template: `retro futurist protest poster, screenprint texture, light cyan and persimmon palette, {weapon subject}, dynamic perspective, simple shapes, minimal text, 2025 dystopian satire`.
- `{weapon subject}` examples: `jury-rigged drone releasing confetti propaganda`, `laid-off coder handing out ransomware USBs`, `tacoma truck loaded with neon barrels`.
- Keep prompts <30 words, avoid trademarked names, describe actions/objects.
